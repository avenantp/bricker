# Deleted_at Column Cleanup Report

## Summary
All references to `deleted_at` and `deleted_by` columns have been removed from the application code.

## Files Modified

### 1. Frontend Type Definitions
**File:** `frontend/src/types/workspaceDiagram.ts`
- **Line 30:** Removed `deleted_at: string | null;` from `WorkspaceDiagram` interface
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 2. Frontend Services
**File:** `frontend/src/services/workspaceDiagramService.ts`
- **Line 192:** Updated comment to remove reference to deleted_at column
- **Before:** "Note: diagrams table doesn't have deleted_at, so this is a hard delete"
- **After:** "(hard delete)"
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 3. Backend MCP Server
**File:** `backend/mcp-servers/schema-analyzer/src/index.ts`
- **Line 412:** Removed 'deleted_at' from timestamp columns array
- **Before:** `['created_at', 'updated_at', 'deleted_at', 'timestamp']`
- **After:** `['created_at', 'updated_at', 'timestamp']`
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

## Files Checked (Clean)

### Frontend Source Code
- ✅ No references to `deleted_at` found in `frontend/src/**/*`
- ✅ No references to `soft_delete` functions found in `frontend/src/**/*`

### Backend Source Code
- ✅ No references to `deleted_at` found in `backend/src/**/*`
- ✅ No references to `soft_delete` functions found in `backend/src/**/*`

### False Positive (Not Changed)
**File:** `frontend/src/lib/conflict-resolution.ts`
- Contains `deleted_by_us` and `deleted_by_them` strings
- **Context:** Git merge conflict resolution messages (not database columns)
- **Status:** ✅ Intentionally left unchanged

## Files NOT Modified (Historical/Documentation)

The following files contain references to `deleted_at` but were intentionally left unchanged as they are:
- Migration files in `supabase/migrations/` (historical record)
- Migration files in `backend/migrations/` (historical record)
- Documentation files in `docs/`
- Migration helper scripts (`apply-migration*.js`, `check-audit-columns.sql`, etc.)

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Searched all `frontend/src` files for `deleted_at` - **0 references found**
2. ✅ Searched all `backend/src` files for `deleted_at` - **0 references found**
3. ✅ Searched all `frontend/src` files for `deleted_by` - **1 false positive (conflict message)**
4. ✅ Searched all `backend/src` files for `deleted_by` - **0 references found**
5. ✅ Searched all source files for `soft_delete` functions - **0 references found**

## Result

✅ **All application code has been cleaned up and no longer references deleted_at or deleted_by columns.**

The application is now ready to run after the database migration (`015_cleanup_audit_columns.sql`) has been applied.

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration `015_cleanup_audit_columns.sql` via Supabase dashboard
2. Restart the development server (if running)
3. Test the dataset editing functionality
4. Verify no console errors appear
