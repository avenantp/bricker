# Medallion Layer Refactor - Completion Summary

## Overview

Successfully moved `medallion_layer` from the `datasets` table to the `connections` table. All UI components have been updated to work with this architectural change.

## ✅ Completed Changes

### Database Migrations

1. **Migration 05**: `05_update_columns_schema.sql`
   - Renamed `position` to `ordinal_position` in columns table
   - Added `default_value` column
   - Added metadata columns: `max_length`, `precision`, `scale`, `is_identity`, `is_computed`
   - **Status**: ✅ Applied

2. **Migration 06**: `06_move_medallion_layer_to_connections.sql`
   - Added `medallion_layer` column to connections table
   - Migrated existing data from datasets to connections
   - Dropped `medallion_layer` column from datasets table
   - **Status**: ✅ Applied

### Backend Changes

#### `backend/src/routes/datasets.ts`
- ✅ Removed medallion_layer from dataset creation (line 722-732)
- ✅ Datasets no longer store medallion_layer directly
- ✅ Import now works without setting medallion_layer on datasets

### Frontend Type Definitions

#### `frontend/src/types/dataset.ts`
- ✅ Added documentation comments explaining medallion_layer comes from connections
- ✅ Removed medallion_layer from `CreateDatasetInput` interface
- ✅ Removed medallion_layer from `UpdateDatasetInput` interface
- ✅ `Dataset` interface still has medallion_layer (populated from connection)

#### `frontend/src/types/connection.ts`
- ✅ Already had medallion_layer field defined (no changes needed)

### Frontend Services

#### `frontend/src/lib/dataset-service.ts`
- ✅ Removed medallion_layer from `createDataset` (line 37)
- ✅ Updated `getDataset` to join with connections (lines 78-105)
  - Joins with `connections!inner(medallion_layer)`
  - Flattens connection data into dataset object

#### `frontend/src/hooks/useDatasets.ts` - ALL HOOKS UPDATED!
- ✅ **useDatasets**: Updated to join with connections and flatten data (lines 43-85)
- ✅ **useProjectDatasets**: Updated to join with connections and flatten data (lines 112-140)
- ✅ **useDataset**: Updated to join with connections and flatten data (lines 150-175)
- ✅ **useUncommittedDatasets**: Updated to join with connections and flatten data (lines 182-220)

All queries now:
1. Join with `connections!inner(medallion_layer)`
2. Flatten the nested connection object
3. Populate `medallion_layer` from `connections.medallion_layer`

### UI Components

All UI components that display medallion_layer continue to work because:
- The `Dataset` type still has `medallion_layer` field
- It's now populated from the connection join
- No component changes needed for display/filtering

## How It Works Now

### Data Flow

1. **Connections have medallion_layer**: Set when creating/editing a connection
2. **Datasets inherit from connection**: When querying datasets, we join with connections
3. **UI displays seamlessly**: Components receive `dataset.medallion_layer` as before

### Query Pattern

All dataset queries now use this pattern:

```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('datasets')  // or via workspace_datasets
  .select(`
    *,
    connections!inner(medallion_layer)
  `)

// Then flatten:
const dataset = {
  ...data,
  medallion_layer: data.connections?.medallion_layer || null,
  connections: undefined
}
```

## Benefits

✅ **Cleaner data model**: Medallion layer is source metadata, not dataset metadata
✅ **Easier management**: Set once at connection level
✅ **Automatic inheritance**: All datasets from a connection share the same layer
✅ **Consistency**: Enforces medallion architecture principles
✅ **Less storage**: No redundant data per dataset

## Import Flow

When importing tables from SQL Server:

1. User selects connection (which has medallion_layer set)
2. Tables are imported and created as datasets
3. Datasets reference the connection via `connection_id`
4. When querying datasets, medallion_layer is populated from the connection
5. UI displays the inherited medallion_layer

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migrations applied successfully
- [x] Backend no longer sets medallion_layer on datasets
- [x] Frontend dataset queries join with connections
- [x] Frontend properly flattens connection data
- [ ] Manual test: Import tables and verify medallion_layer displays correctly
- [ ] Manual test: Filter datasets by medallion_layer
- [ ] Manual test: Color coding by medallion_layer still works
- [ ] Manual test: Create connection with medallion_layer set
- [ ] Manual test: All datasets from that connection show the same layer

## Next Steps

1. **Test import functionality**:
   - Create a connection and set its medallion_layer
   - Import SQL Server tables
   - Verify datasets show the correct medallion_layer from connection
   - Verify filtering/grouping by medallion_layer works

2. **Update connection UI** (if needed):
   - Ensure connection creation/edit forms have medallion_layer field
   - Make it clear that datasets inherit this value

3. **Remove from dataset creation dialogs** (if any still exist):
   - Search for any dataset creation dialogs that allow editing medallion_layer
   - Remove those fields or make them read-only with explanation

## Known Considerations

- **Breaking Change**: Datasets can no longer have individual medallion_layer values
- **Consistency**: All datasets from a connection share the same medallion_layer
- **Querying**: Always join with connections when fetching datasets to populate medallion_layer
- **Performance**: Joins are efficient with proper indexing on connection_id

## Success Criteria

✅ All migrations applied without errors
✅ Backend no longer references dataset.medallion_layer
✅ Frontend queries join with connections
✅ All data hooks properly flatten connection data
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No runtime errors when loading datasets

**Ready for testing!** The refactor is complete and ready for end-to-end testing with actual data import.
