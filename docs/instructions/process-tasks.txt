Analyse the specification referenced in this file @docs\prp\051-dataset-diagram-view-specification.md.

Review current codebase and implment the outstanding tasks in @docs\prp\050-dataset-diagram-view-tasklist.md

For each task:
1. State task number and what you're doing
2. Show proposed changes
3. Do not wait for "Approved" before implementing
4. Confirm completion and ask to proceed to next task
5. As you go please mark tasks as completed in @docs\prp\050-dataset-diagram-view-tasklist.md

If there are any variations or changes required to the database let me know if I need to run SQL migration scripts on Supabase and wait
for approval to proceed.


Analyse the specification referenced in this file @docs\prp\041-dataset-column-specification.md.

Review current codebase against the tasks in @docs\prp\040-dataset-column-tasklist.md

For each task:
1. State task number and what you're doing
2. Show proposed changes
3. Do not wait for "Approved" before implementing
4. Confirm completion and ask to proceed to next task
5. As you go please mark tasks as completed in @docs\prp\040-dataset-column-tasklist.md

Please verify and complete the following task `4.1.2 TypeScript Type Definitions`

If there are any variations or changes required to the database let me know if I need to run SQL migration scripts on Supabase and wait
for approval to proceed.



Please perform a thorough verification audit against our specification and tasklist documents.

Reference documents:
- @docs\prp\051-dataset-diagram-view-specification.md - contains all requirements and design specifications
- @docs\prp\050-dataset-diagram-view-tasklist.md

IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE NOTE:
All Row Level Security (RLS) and access control has been moved to the application layer. 
Do NOT expect or look for database-level RLS policies. Access control is handled through:
- Application-level permission checks
- Middleware/route guards
- Service layer authorization logic
- API endpoint access controls

When verifying security requirements, check the application code for proper authorization 
checks rather than database policies.

Verification process:
1. Read both documents carefully to understand all requirements
2. Go through the codebase and check each item systematically
3. For each requirement/task, verify:
   - Is it fully implemented?
   - Does it work as specified?
   - Are there any edge cases not handled?
   - Does it match the design/behavior described?

4. Test the implementation:
   - Run the application and manually test key features
   - Check for console errors or warnings
   - Verify responsive behavior (if applicable)
   - Test user interactions and flows

5. If you find any issues, fix them and re-verify

Be thorough and critical - don't just check if code exists, verify it actually works 
correctly according to the specifications.
