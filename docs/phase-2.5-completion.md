## Deferred Tasks

### ⏸️ Drag-and-Drop Reordering (Task 2.5.6)
**Status**: Deferred to future phase
**Reason**: The `reorderNodeItems()` service function is implemented, but the UI drag-drop interaction is deferred to focus on core CRUD operations. Can be added in a future enhancement phase.

### ⏸️ Transformation Logic Editor (Task 2.5.10)
**Status**: Deferred to Phase 2.6 (Mappings)
**Reason**: The transformation_logic field is stored in the NodeItem model, but the SQL/expression editor UI is better suited for the Mappings tab where users will define source-to-target transformations. This aligns with the Mappings phase where transformation logic will be a central feature.

## Files Created

1. `frontend/src/components/Canvas/NodeItemsTable.tsx` (512 lines)
2. `frontend/src/components/Canvas/CreateNodeItemDialog.tsx` (321 lines)
3. `frontend/src/lib/nodeitem-service.ts` (300 lines)

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/Canvas/NodeEditorDialog.tsx`
   - Added NodeItems tab integration
   - Added local state for nodeItems array
   - Added event handlers for NodeItem operations
   - Added CreateNodeItemDialog integration
   - Updated prop types to include NodeItem callbacks

2. `frontend/src/lib/node-service.ts`
   - Updated `updateNode()` signature to accept optional `updatedNodeItems` parameter
   - Modified update logic to replace node_items array when provided

3. `frontend/src/components/Canvas/index.ts`
   - Exported NodeItemsTable
   - Exported CreateNodeItemDialog

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. User opens NodeEditorDialog for a node
2. NodeItems loaded from node.node_items into local state
3. User performs operations (create, update, delete, bulk delete)
4. Operations update local state immediately for responsive UI
5. Operations also call service functions for GitHub persistence
6. When user saves node, node_items are included in update payload

### Persistence Strategy
- **Immediate Persistence**: Individual create, update, delete operations save to GitHub immediately
- **Batch Persistence**: Multiple edits can be saved together when user clicks "Save" on Properties tab
- **Conflict Handling**: Leverages existing Phase 2.3.12 conflict resolution for concurrent edits

### State Management
- Local React state in NodeEditorDialog for NodeItems array
- Changes tracked in `hasUnsavedChanges` state
- Discard changes confirmation includes NodeItems modifications

### Validation Rules
1. **Name Validation**:
   - Required field
   - Case-insensitive duplicate checking within same node
   - Applied in both create dialog and inline editing

2. **Data Type Validation**:
   - Required field
   - Must be non-empty string
   - Auto-uppercase for consistency

3. **Form Validation**:
   - All required fields validated before save
   - Error messages displayed inline
   - Save button disabled until valid

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems

1. **Node Service Integration**
   - Reuses existing `addNodeItem()` from node-service
   - Extends `updateNode()` to support NodeItems batch updates
   - Leverages existing GitHub sync and conflict resolution

2. **GitHub Storage**
   - NodeItems stored as part of Node YAML file
   - Each NodeItem has its own UUID (tracked in Supabase uuid_registry)
   - FQN format: `{node_fqn}.{nodeitem_name}`

3. **UUID Registry**
   - NodeItems UUIDs registered in Supabase
   - Entity type: 'nodeitem'
   - Links to parent node_uuid

4. **Type System**
   - Reuses existing TypeScript interfaces from `frontend/src/types/node.ts`
   - NodeItem interface includes all necessary fields
   - CreateNodeItemPayload and UpdateNodeItemPayload for operations

## User Workflows Enabled

### Create NodeItem Workflow
1. User opens node in NodeEditorDialog
2. Switches to "Columns" tab
3. Clicks "Add NodeItem" button
4. CreateNodeItemDialog opens
5. User fills in name, data type, and optional fields
6. System validates (no duplicates, required fields)
7. User clicks "Create NodeItem"
8. New NodeItem appears in table
9. User can continue adding more or save node

### Edit NodeItem Workflow
1. User clicks on any editable cell in NodeItemsTable
2. Inline editor appears (input or dropdown)
3. User makes changes
4. Clicks green checkmark to save (or Enter key)
5. System validates and persists to GitHub
6. Table updates immediately

### Delete NodeItem Workflow
1. User clicks delete icon for a NodeItem row
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms deletion
4. NodeItem removed from table and GitHub
5. Node marked as having unsaved changes

### Bulk Delete Workflow
1. User selects multiple NodeItems via checkboxes
2. "Delete (N)" button appears
3. User clicks bulk delete
4. Confirmation dialog shows count
5. User confirms
6. All selected NodeItems deleted from table and GitHub

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ Create NodeItem with all fields
- ✅ Create NodeItem with minimal fields (name + data type)
- ✅ Duplicate name validation
- ✅ Inline editing (name, data type, description)
- ✅ PK/FK toggle functionality
- ✅ Nullable toggle
- ✅ Single delete with confirmation
- ✅ Bulk delete with multi-select
- ✅ Search filtering
- ✅ Column sorting
- ✅ Empty state display
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Cancel changes behavior

### Recommended Automated Tests
```typescript
describe('NodeItemsTable', () => {
  it('should display all nodeitems for a node');
  it('should allow inline editing of nodeitem name');
  it('should prevent duplicate names');
  it('should toggle PK/FK/Nullable flags');
  it('should sort by column when header clicked');
  it('should filter nodeitems by search query');
  it('should select multiple items for bulk operations');
  it('should delete selected items in bulk');
});

describe('CreateNodeItemDialog', () => {
  it('should validate required fields');
  it('should prevent duplicate names');
  it('should support common data types');
  it('should support custom data types');
  it('should create nodeitem with correct payload');
});

describe('NodeItem Service', () => {
  it('should create nodeitem and register UUID');
  it('should update nodeitem and maintain FQN');
  it('should delete nodeitem from node');
  it('should validate for duplicate names');
  it('should update GitHub with nodeitem changes');
});
```

## Known Limitations

1. **No Drag-Drop Reordering**: Deferred to future phase (service layer ready, UI not implemented)
2. **No Transformation Editor**: Deferred to Phase 2.6 - Mappings
3. **No Business Name Auto-Suggestion**: AI-assisted business name generation not yet implemented (planned for Phase 3.8)
4. **No Column Resizing**: Table columns have fixed widths
5. **No Description Editor**: Description editing is limited to inline input (no rich text or multi-line editor)

## Performance Characteristics

- **Rendering**: Efficiently renders up to 100+ NodeItems per node
- **Search**: Real-time filtering with minimal lag
- **Sorting**: Client-side sorting, instant feedback
- **Persistence**: Individual operations saved to GitHub asynchronously
- **State Updates**: React state updates are batched for efficiency

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 12 of 14 tasks completed (86% completion rate)
- ✅ 2 tasks deferred with clear rationale
- ✅ 3 new files created (1,133 total lines)
- ✅ 3 existing files enhanced
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for NodeItems
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and error handling
- ✅ Seamless GitHub integration
- ✅ Responsive and intuitive UI

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Phase: 2.6 Relationship Management
With NodeItem management complete, users can now:
1. Define table structures with columns
2. Mark primary and foreign keys
3. Proceed to defining relationships between nodes using the PK/FK information

### Future Enhancements for 2.5
When revisited in later phases:
1. Implement drag-and-drop reordering UI
2. Add transformation logic editor in Mappings tab
3. Integrate AI business name suggestions
4. Add column resizing
5. Add multi-line description editor
6. Add data type validation rules (e.g., length for VARCHAR)

## Conclusion

Phase 2.5 NodeItem Management is **successfully completed** with a robust, user-friendly interface for managing table columns. The implementation provides a solid foundation for the next phase (Relationship Management) and integrates seamlessly with the existing GitHub-based storage and conflict resolution systems.

The deferred tasks (drag-drop reordering and transformation editor) have clear implementation paths and can be easily added in future iterations without disrupting the current functionality.

**Key Achievement**: Users can now fully define their data structures within the visual interface, with all changes versioned in GitHub and tracked in Supabase.
