# Critical Findings - SQL Server Connection Issue

## Test Results Summary

We've run comprehensive tests and identified the root cause.

### ✅ What's Working
- Backend API is running and receiving requests correctly
- Configuration is being built correctly
- SQL Server service is running
- Code changes for Encrypt dropdown are implemented correctly

### ❌ Root Cause Identified

**Node.js cannot establish a TCP connection to port 1433 at all.**

Error: `ECONNREFUSED` on both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

This means:
- ✅ Node.js CAN reach the network stack (not a firewall timeout)
- ❌ The connection is being ACTIVELY REFUSED
- ❌ SQL Server is NOT listening on IPv4 port 1433 (127.0.0.1:1433)

## The Discrepancy

You mentioned:
> "the server is listening on port 1433 and i can connect with all other tools"

But our TCP test shows port 1433 is **REFUSING connections** from Node.js.

## Possible Explanations

### 1. SQL Server Listening on IPv6 Only

SQL Server may be listening on:
- ✅ `[::1]:1433` (IPv6 localhost) ← SSMS uses this
- ❌ `127.0.0.1:1433` (IPv4 localhost) ← Node.js tries this

**How to Check:**
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr ":1433"
```

Look for these lines:
```
TCP    0.0.0.0:1433           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING    [PID]
TCP    127.0.0.1:1433         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING    [PID]
TCP    [::]:1433              [::]:0                 LISTENING    [PID]
```

**What You Need:**
- `0.0.0.0:1433` - Listening on ALL IPv4 addresses
- OR `127.0.0.1:1433` - Listening on IPv4 localhost

**If you ONLY see:**
- `[::]:1433` or `[::1]:1433` - That's IPv6 only, which explains the issue!

### 2. SQL Server Listening on Specific Network Adapter

SQL Server may be bound to a specific network adapter IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100:1433`) instead of all interfaces (`0.0.0.0:1433`).

**How to Fix:**

1. Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**
2. Navigate to: **SQL Server Network Configuration** → **Protocols for MSSQLSERVER**
3. Right-click **TCP/IP** → **Properties**
4. Go to **IP Addresses** tab
5. For **EACH IP section** (IP1, IP2, IP3, etc.):
   - Set **Enabled** = **Yes**
   - Set **TCP Port** = **1433**
6. Scroll to **IPAll** section at the bottom:
   - **TCP Dynamic Ports**: (leave BLANK)
   - **TCP Port**: **1433**
7. Click **OK**
8. **Restart SQL Server service**:
   ```cmd
   net stop MSSQLSERVER
   net start MSSQLSERVER
   ```

### 3. SQL Server Express with Named Instance

If you're using SQL Server Express, the default instance name is `SQLEXPRESS`, not `MSSQLSERVER`.

**How to Check:**
```cmd
sc query | findstr "SQL"
```

**If you see `MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS`:**
- You need to connect to: `localhost\\SQLEXPRESS`
- Named instances use dynamic ports by default
- You need to enable SQL Server Browser service

**How to Fix:**
```cmd
# Start SQL Server Browser
net start SQLBrowser

# Set it to start automatically
sc config SQLBrowser start=auto
```

**Then connect using:**
- Server: `localhost\\SQLEXPRESS`
- Port: Leave blank (will be determined by Browser)

### 4. Windows Hosts File Override

Check if `localhost` is being redirected to IPv6.

**How to Check:**
```cmd
type C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts | findstr "localhost"
```

**What You Should See:**
```
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
```

**If you see ONLY:**
```
::1             localhost
```

Then `localhost` resolves to IPv6 only, causing the connection to fail.

**How to Fix:**
Add this line to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`:
```
127.0.0.1       localhost
```

## Action Required

**Please run this command and share the output:**

```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr ":1433"
```

This will tell us exactly what's listening on port 1433 and whether it's IPv4 or IPv6.

## Expected Output (Working Configuration)

You should see:
```
TCP    0.0.0.0:1433           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING    [PID]
TCP    [::]:1433              [::]:0                 LISTENING    [PID]
```

This means SQL Server is listening on:
- `0.0.0.0:1433` - All IPv4 addresses (Node.js can connect)
- `[::]:1433` - All IPv6 addresses (SSMS can use this)

## What We've Tested

| Test | Result | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| Backend API | ✅ Working | Code is correct |
| Config building | ✅ Correct | Parameters are right |
| Encryption modes | ❌ All fail | Not encryption issue |
| Windows Auth (trustedConnection) | ❌ Fails | Not auth method issue |
| Windows Auth (NTLM) | ❌ Fails | Not auth method issue |
| SQL Auth test | ⏳ Needs password | Can't test yet |
| TCP connectivity | ❌ **ECONNREFUSED** | **SQL Server not on IPv4:1433** |

## Quick Tests You Can Run

### Test 1: What's listening on port 1433?
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr ":1433"
```

### Test 2: What SQL Server instances are installed?
```cmd
sc query | findstr "SQL"
```

### Test 3: Can telnet connect?
```cmd
telnet localhost 1433
```

If telnet fails with "Could not open connection", it confirms SQL Server is not listening on IPv4 port 1433.

### Test 4: Check SQL Server error log
```powershell
Get-Content "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL*.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG" | Select-String "listening"
```

Look for lines like:
```
Server is listening on [ 'any' <ipv4> 1433]
```

If you DON'T see this, SQL Server is not listening on IPv4.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Run `netstat -ano | findstr ":1433"` and share the output**
2. Check if you're using a named instance (SQLEXPRESS)
3. Verify TCP/IP is enabled for IPv4 in SQL Server Configuration Manager
4. Restart SQL Server service after any configuration changes

## Alternative: Use Docker SQL Server

If you want to bypass all these configuration issues:

```bash
docker-compose up -d sqlserver
```

Then use these connection settings:
- Server: `localhost`
- Port: `1433`
- Username: `sa`
- Password: `YourStrong@Passw0rd`
- Encrypt: `Optional`
- Trust certificate: ✅

Docker SQL Server will work immediately with no configuration needed.
