# Soft Delete Implementation - Phase 2 & 3 Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ All Phases Complete - Restore, Cleanup, UI, and Audit Dashboard

## Summary

Successfully implemented Phase 2 (Restore functionality and cleanup job) and Phase 3 (Recently Deleted UI and Audit Dashboard) of the soft delete system. The application now has a complete soft delete solution with restore capabilities, automated cleanup, user-friendly trash views, and administrative monitoring.

---

## Phase 2 Implementation ✅

### 1. Restore Backend Endpoints

Created comprehensive REST APIs for restoring soft deleted records:

**New Backend Routes:**

#### A. Dataset Restore (`backend/src/routes/datasets.ts`)

- **POST /api/datasets/:dataset_id/restore**
  - Restores soft deleted dataset
  - Tracks restoration in change log
  - Returns: `{ success: true, message: "Dataset restored" }`

- **GET /api/datasets/:workspace_id/deleted**
  - Lists all soft deleted datasets for a workspace
  - Ordered by deletion date (newest first)
  - Returns: `{ datasets: [...] }`

- **DELETE /api/datasets/:dataset_id/permanent**
  - Permanently deletes dataset (only if already soft deleted)
  - Cannot be undone
  - Returns: `{ success: true, message: "Dataset permanently deleted" }`

- **POST /api/datasets/:dataset_id/columns/:column_id/restore**
  - Restores soft deleted column
  - Marks dataset as uncommitted
  - Returns: `{ success: true, message: "Column restored" }`

#### B. Project Restore (`backend/src/routes/projects.ts` - NEW FILE)

- **POST /api/projects/:project_id/restore**
  - Restores soft deleted project
  - Returns: `{ success: true, message: "Project restored" }`

- **GET /api/projects/deleted/:account_id**
  - Lists all soft deleted projects for an account
  - Returns: `{ projects: [...] }`

- **DELETE /api/projects/:project_id/permanent**
  - Permanently deletes project (only if already soft deleted)
  - Returns: `{ success: true, message: "Project permanently deleted" }`

#### C. Workspace Restore (`backend/src/routes/workspaces.ts` - NEW FILE)

- **POST /api/workspaces/:workspace_id/restore**
  - Restores soft deleted workspace
  - Returns: `{ success: true, message: "Workspace restored" }`

- **GET /api/workspaces/deleted/:project_id**
  - Lists all soft deleted workspaces for a project
  - Returns: `{ workspaces: [...] }`

- **DELETE /api/workspaces/:workspace_id/permanent**
  - Permanently deletes workspace (only if already soft deleted)
  - Returns: `{ success: true, message: "Workspace permanently deleted" }`

**Backend Route Registration:**

Updated `backend/src/index.ts` to register new routes:
```typescript
app.use('/api/projects', projectsRouter);
app.use('/api/workspaces', workspacesRouter);
```

### 2. Restore Frontend Service Functions

Added restore functions to all frontend service files:

#### A. Dataset Service (`frontend/src/lib/dataset-service.ts`)

```typescript
// Restore soft deleted dataset
export async function restoreDataset(datasetId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>

// Get soft deleted datasets for workspace
export async function getDeletedDatasets(workspaceId: string): Promise<Dataset[]>

// Permanently delete dataset (only if soft deleted)
export async function permanentlyDeleteDataset(datasetId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>
```

#### B. Project Service (`frontend/src/lib/services/project-service.ts`)

```typescript
// Restore soft deleted project
async restoreProject(projectId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>

// Get soft deleted projects for account
async getDeletedProjects(accountId: string): Promise<Project[]>

// Permanently delete project (only if soft deleted)
async permanentlyDeleteProject(projectId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>
```

#### C. Workspace Service (`frontend/src/lib/services/workspace-service.ts`)

```typescript
// Restore soft deleted workspace
async restoreWorkspace(workspaceId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>

// Get soft deleted workspaces for project
async getDeletedWorkspaces(projectId: string): Promise<Workspace[]>

// Permanently delete workspace (only if soft deleted)
async permanentlyDeleteWorkspace(workspaceId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>
```

### 3. Cleanup Job for Old Deleted Records

Created automated cleanup job to permanently delete old soft deleted records:

**File:** `backend/src/jobs/cleanup-soft-deleted.ts`

**Features:**
- Configurable retention period (default: 90 days)
- Processes all 12 soft delete tables
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Summary statistics and detailed results
- CLI interface for manual execution
- Can be scheduled via cron or task scheduler

**Usage:**

```bash
# Run with default retention (90 days)
npm run cleanup

# Run with custom retention period
npm run cleanup:30   # 30 days
npm run cleanup:60   # 60 days
npm run cleanup:90   # 90 days

# Or with custom value
npx tsx backend/src/jobs/cleanup-soft-deleted.ts 45
```

**Output Example:**
```
============================================================
[Cleanup] Starting Soft Delete Cleanup Job
[Cleanup] Retention Period: 90 days
[Cleanup] Tables to Process: 12
============================================================
[Cleanup] Processing table: datasets (retention: 90 days)
[Cleanup] ✓ Cleaned datasets: 5 record(s) permanently deleted
...
============================================================
[Cleanup] Job Complete
[Cleanup] Duration: 2.34s
[Cleanup] Tables Processed: 12
[Cleanup] Successful: 12
[Cleanup] Failed: 0
[Cleanup] Total Records Permanently Deleted: 23
============================================================
```

**Scheduling (Optional):**

Windows Task Scheduler:
```bash
schtasks /create /tn "Uroq Cleanup Job" /tr "C:\Code\uroq\backend\node_modules\.bin\tsx C:\Code\uroq\backend\src\jobs\cleanup-soft-deleted.ts" /sc weekly /d SUN /st 02:00
```

Linux/Mac Cron:
```cron
# Run every Sunday at 2 AM
0 2 * * 0 cd /path/to/uroq && npm run cleanup
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Query Optimization

1. **Indexes Already Created:**
   - Active record indexes: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
   - Deleted record indexes: `WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL`

2. **Efficient Queries:**
   - All list queries use proper indexes
   - Audit dashboard queries are batched per table
   - No N+1 query issues

3. **Large Dataset Handling:**
   - Consider pagination for trash views with many deleted items
   - Audit dashboard already limits to relevant tables only

### Cleanup Job Optimization

1. **Current Implementation:**
   - Processes tables sequentially
   - Uses database RPC function for efficiency
   - Logs progress for monitoring

2. **Potential Optimizations:**
   - Run in parallel for multiple tables (if needed)
   - Add progress indicators for large operations
   - Implement dry-run mode for testing

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control

**Recommendations:**
- Restore operations: Require user to have edit permissions on entity
- Permanent delete: Require admin permissions
- Audit dashboard: Require admin permissions
- Cleanup job: Require system/admin permissions

### 2. Audit Logging

All operations are logged:
- Soft delete: Logged via trackChange()
- Restore: Logged via logAuditChange()
- Permanent delete: Logged via logAuditChange()

### 3. Data Retention Compliance

- Default 90-day retention meets most compliance requirements
- Configurable retention period for different regulations
- Permanent deletion is irreversible (complies with "right to be forgotten")

---

## Maintenance Tasks

### Daily
- None (system is self-maintaining)

### Weekly
- Run cleanup job (if scheduled) - automated
- Review audit dashboard for unusual patterns - manual

### Monthly
- Review audit dashboard for high deletion rates
- Adjust retention period if needed
- Check disk space savings from cleanup

### Quarterly
- Review and update RLS policies (see RLS section below)
- Update documentation if new tables added
- Test restore functionality

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Limitations

1. **No Cascade Restore:**
   - Restoring a project does NOT restore its soft deleted workspaces
   - Restoring a workspace does NOT restore its soft deleted datasets
   - User must manually restore children if needed

2. **No Batch Operations:**
   - Cannot restore multiple items at once from UI
   - Cannot permanently delete multiple items at once
   - Must be done individually

3. **No Search/Filter in Trash:**
   - Recently deleted views don't have search functionality
   - All deleted items shown (may need pagination for large lists)

4. **No Restore Preview:**
   - Cannot preview what restoring an item will affect
   - No validation of dependencies before restore

### Future Enhancements

1. **Cascade Restore Option:**
   ```typescript
   restoreProject(projectId, options: { cascadeRestore: boolean })
   ```

2. **Batch Operations:**
   ```typescript
   restoreBatch(itemIds: string[])
   permanentlyDeleteBatch(itemIds: string[])
   ```

3. **Search and Filter:**
   - Search by name
   - Filter by deletion date
   - Filter by user who deleted

4. **Restore Validation:**
   - Check for conflicts before restore
   - Preview restore dependencies
   - Validate constraints

5. **Email Notifications:**
   - Notify users before permanent deletion
   - Send weekly summary of deleted items

6. **Restore from Backup:**
   - Integrate with backup system
   - Restore items older than retention period

---

## RLS Policies (Pending - Important!)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Row-level security policies have NOT been updated yet. This is a critical task that should be completed before production deployment.

### Required Actions:

1. **Audit Current RLS Policies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, roles, cmd, qual
   FROM pg_policies
   WHERE schemaname = 'public'
   AND tablename IN (
     'accounts', 'projects', 'workspaces', 'datasets', 'columns',
     'connections', 'configurations', 'environments', 'macros', 'templates'
   );
   ```

2. **Update Each Policy to Include deleted_at Filter:**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Update datasets SELECT policy
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS select_datasets_policy ON datasets;

   CREATE POLICY select_datasets_policy ON datasets
     FOR SELECT
     USING (
       deleted_at IS NULL  -- Only show active records
       AND (
         -- existing permissions logic
         account_id IN (SELECT account_id FROM user_accounts WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
       )
     );
   ```

3. **Create Special Admin Policies:**
   ```sql
   -- Allow admins to see deleted records
   CREATE POLICY select_deleted_datasets_admin ON datasets
     FOR SELECT
     USING (
       deleted_at IS NOT NULL
       AND auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin')
     );
   ```

4. **Test RLS Policies:**
   - Verify regular users cannot see soft deleted records
   - Verify admins can see soft deleted records (if allowed)
   - Verify restore operations work with RLS enabled

**See:** `SOFT_DELETE_AUDIT_REPORT.md` Priority 2, Item #5 for detailed RLS update instructions.
